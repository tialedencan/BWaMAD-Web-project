                  Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family and 
                  the name of its edible fruit. A scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, it is a highly 
                  cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Watermelon is grown in favorable climates from tropical to temperate regions worldwide for 
                  its large edible fruit, which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is 
                  botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many 
                  black seeds, although seedless varieties exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and 
                  the rind is edible after cooking. It may also be consumed as a juice or an ingredient in 
                  mixed beverages.

                  Kordofan melons from Sudan are the closest relatives and may be progenitors of modern, 
                  cultivated watermelons. Wild watermelon seeds were found in Uan Muhuggiag, a prehistoric
                  site in Libya that dates to approximately 3500 BC.Watermelons were domesticated in north-east 
                  Africa, and cultivated in Egypt by 2000 BC, although they were not the sweet modern variety. 
                  Sweet dessert watermelons spread across the Mediterranean world during Roman times.

                <p>
                  Considerable breeding effort has developed disease-resistant varieties. Many cultivars are 
                  available that produce mature fruit within 100 days of planting. In 2017, China produced 
                  about two-thirds of the world's total of watermelons.

                <h3>Description</h3> 
                <p>
                  The watermelon is an annual that has a prostrate or climbing habit. Stems are up to 3 metres 
                  (10 feet) long and new growth has yellow or brown hairs. Leaves are 60 to 200 millimetres 
                  (2+1⁄4 to 7+3⁄4 inches) long and 40 to 150 mm (1+1⁄2 to 6 in) wide. These usually have three 
                  lobes that are lobed or doubly lobed. Young growth is densely woolly with yellowish-brown hairs 
                  which disappear as the plant ages. Like all but one species in the genus Citrullus, watermelon 
                  has branching tendrils. Plants have unisexual male or female flowers that are white or yellow 
                  and borne on 40-millimetre-long (1+1⁄2 in) hairy stalks. Each flower grows singly in the leaf axils, 
                  and the species' sexual system, with male and female flowers produced on each plant, is (monoecious). 
                  The male flowers predominate at the beginning of the season; the female flowers, which develop later, 
                  have inferior ovaries. The styles are united into a single column.[citation needed]
                </p>
                <p>
                  The large fruit is a kind of modified berry called a pepo with a thick rind (exocarp) and fleshy center 
                  (mesocarp and endocarp). Wild plants have fruits up to 20 cm (8 in) in diameter, while cultivated 
                  varieties may exceed 60 cm (24 in). The rind of the fruit is mid- to dark green and usually mottled or 
                  striped, and the flesh, containing numerous pips spread throughout the inside, can be red or pink 
                  (most commonly), orange, yellow, green or white.

                  A bitter watermelon, C. amarus, has become naturalized in semiarid regions of several continents, 
                  and is designated as a "pest plant" in parts of Western Australia where they are called "pig melon"

                <h3>Taxonomy</h3> 
                <p>
                  The sweet watermelon was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 and given the name Cucurbita 
                  citrullus. It was reassigned to the genus Citrullus in 1836, under the replacement name Citrullus 
                  vulgaris, by the German botanist Heinrich Adolf Schrader. (The International Code of Nomenclature 
                  for algae, fungi, and plants does not allow names like "Citrullus citrullus".)
                </p> 
                <p>
                  The species is further divided into several varieties, of which bitter wooly melon (Citrullus lanatus 
                  (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai var. lanatus), citron melons (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides (L. H. Bailey) 
                  Mansf.), and the edible var. vulgaris may be the most important. This taxonomy originated with the 
                  erroneous synonymization of the wooly melon Citrullus lanatus with the sweet watermelon Citrullus 
                  vulgaris by L.H. Bailey in 1930. Molecular data, including sequences from the original collection 
                  of Thunberg and other relevant type material, show that the sweet watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris Schrad.) 
                  and the bitter wooly melon Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai are not closely related to each 
                  other.A proposal to conserve the name, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai, was accepted by the 
                  nomenclature committee and confirmed at the International Botanical Congress in 2017.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The wild species closest to Citrullus lanatus are the tendril-less melon Citrullus ecirrhosus Cogn. 
                  From South African arid regions and Citrullus mucosospermus (Fursa) Fursa from West Africa, which is 
                  also sometimes considered a subspecies within C. lanatus. Watermelon populations from Sudan are also 
                  close to domesticated watermelons. The bitter wooly melon was formally described by Carl Peter 
                  Thunberg in 1794 and given the name Momordica lanata. It was reassigned to the genus Citrullus in 
                  1916 by Japanese botanists Jinzō Matsumura and Takenoshin Nakai.
