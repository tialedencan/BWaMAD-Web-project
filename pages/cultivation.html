          <h1>Cultivation</h1>
          <p>
              Watermelons are plants grown from tropical to temperate climates, needing temperatures higher 
              than about 25 °C (77 °F) to thrive. On a garden scale, seeds are usually sown in pots under 
              cover and transplanted into well-drained sandy loam with a pH between 5.5 and 7 and medium 
              levels of nitrogen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Major pests of the watermelon include aphids, fruit flies, and root-knot nematodes. In conditions 
            of high humidity, the plants are prone to plant diseases such as powdery mildew and mosaic virus.
            Some varieties often grown in Japan and other parts of the Far East are susceptible to fusarium wilt.
            Grafting such varieties onto disease-resistant rootstocks offers protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The US Department of Agriculture recommends using at least one beehive per acre (4,000 m2 per hive) 
            for pollination of conventional, seeded varieties for commercial plantings. Seedless hybrids have 
            sterile pollen. This requires planting pollinizer rows of varieties with viable pollen. Since the 
            supply of viable pollen is reduced, and pollination is much more critical in producing the seedless 
            variety, the recommended number of hives per acre increases to three hives per acre (1,300 m2 per hive).
             Watermelons have a longer growing period than other melons and can often take 85 days or more from 
             the time of transplanting for the fruit to mature. Lack of pollen is thought to contribute to 
             "hollow heart" which causes the flesh of the watermelon to develop a large hole, sometimes in an 
             intricate, symmetric shape. Watermelons suffering from hollow heart are safe to consume.
          </p>

                Farmers of the Zentsuji region of Japan found a way to grow cubic watermelons by growing the fruits 
                in metal and glass boxes and making them assume the shape of the receptacle. The cubic shape 
                was originally designed to make the melons easier to stack and store, but these "square watermelons" 
                may be triple the price of normal ones, so appeal mainly to wealthy urban consumers. Pyramid-shaped 
                watermelons have also been developed, and any polyhedral shape may potentially be used.
              </p>       
              <p>
                Watermelons, which are called Tsamma in Khoisan language and Makataan in Tswana language, are 
                important water sources in South Africa, the Kalahari desert and East Africa for both humans 
                and animals.

          </p>
          <p>
            DNA data reveal that C. lanatus var. citroides Bailey is the same as Thunberg's bitter wooly melon, 
            C. lanatus and also the same as C. amarus Schrad. It is not a form of the sweet watermelon C. 
            vulgaris nor closely related to that species.
            The citron melon or makataan – a variety with sweet yellow flesh that is cultivated around the world 
            for fodder and the production of citron peel and pectin.

          <p>(syn. C. lanatus var. caffer)</p>
          <p>
            C. caffer Schrad. is a synonym of C. amarus Schrad.
            The variety known as tsamma is grown for its juicy white flesh. 
            The variety was an important food source for travellers in the Kalahari Desert.
            Another variety known as karkoer or bitterboela is unpalatable to humans, 
            but the seeds may be eaten.
            A small-fruited form with a bumpy skin has caused poisoning in sheep.

            This West African species is the closest wild relative of the watermelon. 
            It is cultivated for cattle feed.
            Additionally, other wild species have bitter fruit containing cucurbitacin.

          <p>The more than 1,200[34] cultivars of watermelon range in weight from less than 1 kilogram 
            (2+1⁄4 pounds) to more than 90 kg (200 lb); the flesh can be red, pink, orange, yellow or white.

              The 'Carolina Cross' produced the current world record for heaviest watermelon, 
              weighing 159 kg (351 lb).[35] It has green skin, red flesh and commonly produces 
              fruit between 29 and 68 kg (65 and 150 lb). It takes about 90 days from planting to harvest.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 'Golden Midget' has a golden rind and pink flesh when ripe, and takes 70 days 
              from planting to harvest.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 'Orangeglo' has a very sweet orange flesh, and is a large, oblong fruit weighing 
              9–14 kg (20–31 lb). It has a light green rind with jagged dark green stripes. 
              It takes about 90–100 days from planting to harvest.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 'Moon and Stars' variety was created in 1926.The rind is purple/black and has many small 
              yellow circles (stars) and one or two large yellow circles (moon). The melon weighs 9–23 kg 
              (20–51 lb).[40] The flesh is pink or red and has brown seeds. The foliage is also spotted. 
              The time from planting to harvest is about 90 days.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 'Cream of Saskatchewan' has small, round fruits about 25 cm (10 in) in diameter. 
              It has a thin, light and dark green striped rind, and sweet white flesh with black seeds. 
              It can grow well in cool climates. It was originally brought to Saskatchewan, Canada, by 
              Russian immigrants. The melon takes 80–85 days from planting to harvest.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 'Melitopolski' has small, round fruits roughly 28–30 cm (11–12 in) in diameter. 
              It is an early ripening variety that originated from the Astrakhan region of Russia, 
              an area known for cultivation of watermelons. The Melitopolski watermelons are seen 
              piled high by vendors in Moscow in the summer. This variety takes around 95 days from 
              planting to harvest.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 'Densuke' watermelon has round fruit up to 11 kg (24 lb). The rind is black with no 
              stripes or spots. It is grown only on the island of Hokkaido, Japan, where up to 10,000 
              watermelons are produced every year. In June 2008, one of the first harvested watermelons 
              was sold at an auction for 650,000 yen (US$6,300), making it the most expensive watermelon 
              ever sold. The average selling price is generally around 25,000 yen ($250).
            </li>
            <li>
              Many cultivars are no longer grown commercially because of their thick rind, but seeds may 
              be available among home gardeners and specialty seed companies. This thick rind is desirable 
              for making watermelon pickles, and some old cultivars favoured for this purpose include 
              'Tom Watson', 'Georgia Rattlesnake', and 'Black Diamond'.
