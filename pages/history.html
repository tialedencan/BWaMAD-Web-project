              Watermelons were originally cultivated for their high water content and were stored to be 
              eaten during dry seasons, not only as a food source, but as a method of storing water.
              Watermelon seeds were found in the Dead Sea region at the ancient settlements of Bab edh-Dhra 
              and Tel Arad.

              Many 5000-year-old wild watermelon seeds (C. lanatus) were discovered at Uan Muhuggiag, a 
              prehistoric archaeological site located in southwestern Libya. This archaeobotanical discovery 
              may support the possibility that the plant was more widely distributed in the past.

              In the 7th century, watermelons were being cultivated in India, and by the 10th century had 
              reached China. The Moors introduced the fruit into the Iberian Peninsula, and there is evidence 
              of it being cultivated in CÃ³rdoba in 961 and also in Seville in 1158. It spread northwards 
              through southern Europe, perhaps limited in its advance by summer temperatures being insufficient 
              for good yields. The fruit had begun appearing in European herbals by 1600, and was widely planted 
              in Europe in the 17th century as a minor garden crop.

              Early watermelons were not sweet, but bitter, with yellowish-white flesh and difficult to open. 
              Through breeding, watermelons later tasted better and were easier to open.

              European colonists and enslaved people from Africa introduced the watermelon to the New World. 
              Spanish settlers were growing it in Florida in 1576. It was being grown in Massachusetts by 1629, 
              and by 1650 was being cultivated in Peru, Brazil and Panama. Around the same time, Native Americans 
              were cultivating the crop in the Mississippi valley and Florida. Watermelons were rapidly accepted 
              in Hawaii and other Pacific islands when they were introduced there by explorers such as Captain 
              James Cook. In the Civil War era United States, watermelons were commonly grown by free black 
              people and became one symbol for the abolition of slavery. After the Civil War, black people 
              were maligned for their association with watermelon. The sentiment evolved into a racist stereotype 
              where black people shared a supposed voracious appetite for watermelon, a fruit long correlated 
              with laziness and uncleanliness.

              Seedless watermelons were initially developed in 1939 by Japanese scientists who were able to 
              create seedless triploid hybrids which remained rare initially because they did not have sufficient 
              disease resistance. Seedless watermelons became more popular in the 21st century, rising to 
              nearly 85% of total watermelon sales in the United States in 2014.
